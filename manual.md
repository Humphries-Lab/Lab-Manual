Introduction
============

Hello reader, welcome to the Humphries' lab. We are a neural data lab:
we analyse neuroscience data to test computational theories of how
brains work. To do this, we often have to create new analysis
approaches; and we build models of neurons and circuits to test the
match between theories and data. As a purely computational lab, we are
at liberty to have looser rules than our experimental colleagues. This
manual lays out how the lab works, and the expectations of everyone
within it.

Practical information: how the lab works day-to-day
===================================================

How labs work evolves over time as they grow or shrink, as they change
direction, or move institution. This is how we currently work:

Intra-lab communication

:   We use Slack for all intra-lab communication. We use Slack precisely
    so that we do not have to turn on email to talk to each other. It
    ensures you can contact Mark easily. Each major project has its own
    channel in Slack. See below for our notifications policy.\
    **Action**: Install Slack on your work PC, and anything else you
    want to.

Lab scheduling

:   The lab has a Google Calendar to track all scheduled lab events
    (meetings, visitors etc). It has two other main functions: for
    everyone to enter their holidays; and for adding interesting
    external events (local seminars, conferences etc).\
    **Action**: Ask Mark to give you access to the lab calendar.

Lab meetings

:   : lab meetings are weekly\*, from 12-1pm. Meeting content
    alternates: week 1 is a data club; week 2 is a journal club; both
    follow a rota so all members will present. Data clubs are a chance
    to present your latest results, your problems you want to solve, or
    plans. When in the midst of writing paper, data clubs are a chance
    to talk through the paper, explaining the figures in order. A useful
    guide to presenting work-in-progress papers in lab meetings is here:
    <https://dreamingofchickens.com/2019/03/03/how-to-write-and-other-things-were-supposed-to-be-teaching-trainees/>\
    \* Weekly is an aspiration. Weeks will be missed when sufficient
    numbers of people are absent

Data storage

:   We're still grappling with Nottingham's new systems. The aspiration
    is that each major data analysis project will store its data in a
    separate folder on Sharepoint.

Code

:   We use Matlab by default; everyone is encouraged to use and/or learn
    Python. Mark does not know Python, as he is a dinosaur. We like the
    look of Julia, but have not been brave enough to dive in yet.\
    **Action**: Matlab should already be installed on your PC. Register
    your Nottingham email address with Mathworks, and the institutional
    license will let you install copies of Matlab wherever you want.

Code sharing

:   We use GitHub for code sharing. Consequently, we use Git for version
    control when needed. We strive to upload all our computational
    models to ModelDB.

Writing

:   We write all papers in LaTeX by default; for co-writing papers with
    collaborators who do not know LaTeX, we will use Word with gritted
    teeth. Or Google Docs like a sane person.

Graphics

:   We currently prefer Inkscape for our main needs: laying out panels
    into figures; editing them; and making schematics.

Some useful information on when you are and are not supposed to be
working:

University holidays

:   : <https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/about/keydates/index.aspx>\
    Note in particular that UK universities close completely over
    Christmas.

UK public holidays

:   : <https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays>\
    p.s. the UK calls all public holidays "bank holidays".

Roles and responsibilities
==========================

Who does what, and what to expect of them -- and yourself.

PI
--

You can expect me to do the following:

-   Have a vision of where the lab is going.

-   Be aware of where the field(s) are going.

-   Care about your happiness.

-   Create and submit funding applications to support the science in the
    lab.

-   Support you in your career development, including:

    -   helping you prepare for a successful career both in and out of
        academia

    -   writing letters of recommendation

    -   introductions to other scientists

    -   funding trips to relevant conferences

    -   funding training at advanced schools

    -   promoting your work in talks

    -   inviting you to jointly peer review papers

    -   make available to you example grant applications, both
        successful and unsuccessful. Comparing the two will show the
        fine margins involved.

-   Support you in your personal growth by giving you flexibility in
    working hours and environment, and encouraging you to do things
    other than science.

-   Be available to meet with you, to talk about your science, about
    your future plans, and any other issues you want to raise.

-   Provide feedback in a timely manner on abstracts, posters, job and
    fellowship applications

-   Work with you on your papers. Sometimes this will be comments on a
    manuscript; sometimes this will be redrafting; sometimes this will
    be working on code.

**What does a PI do?** For better or for worse, the best way to
understand how a modern biomedical lab works is to picture it as a small
tech start-up. It pitches projects to raise funds from investors, hires
people to work on projects, and produces outputs from those projects
(scientific ones: papers, techniques, and code). And just like a
start-up, it has to deal with all the admin of a business: HR,
accounting, marketing etc. A PI does all the things that a start-up CEO
does: pitches; fund-raises; interviews and hires people; leads projects;
advertising and marketing; accounting; quality control of products.
Also, as they are employed by a University, they teach and sit on
administrative committees. This is why succeeding in academia is about
more than just being good at science.

Postdoc
-------

Postdocs are research positions typically funded from research grants.
As a postdoc in the lab you are expected to:

-   Develop your own independent line of research. If funded from a
    specific project grant, the aims and ideas of that grant are your
    starting point, not the end-goals.

-   Become the lab expert in your line of research, including reading
    the literature

-   Regularly update Mark on your progress: from short messages on what
    problem you're tackling now, to in-person meetings on key results
    and decision points

-   Challenge me (Mark) when I'm wrong or when your opinion is different

-   Help train and mentor students in the lab (whether undergraduate,
    MSc, or PhD) when they need it -- either because they ask, or
    because I ask you to

-   Present your work: at local events; at other labs; and at
    conferences

-   Plan your future, as appropriate:

    -   Apply for jobs (academic, industry or third sector) when you're
        ready, but no later than 6 months before the end of your current
        postdoc contract. There are more, and in many ways better, jobs
        outside academia, for which you are well-qualified.

    -   Apply for fellowships, well in advance of the end of your
        postdoc. For external funders (UKRI etc), the typical lag
        between submission deadlines and being able to start a
        Fellowship is a minimum of 10 months. Submission deadlines are
        at most three times a year; many schemes are once a year. Plan
        well in advance.

-   Take responsibility for your career development: produce work in a
    timely fashion necessary to support your own career; where
    practicable, take advantage of the opportunities that arise from
    working in the lab

PhD student
-----------

-   Develop a line of research for your thesis. Developed with Mark's
    help.

-   Read the literature in your research area

-   Regularly update Mark on your progress: from short messages on what
    problem you're tackling now, to in-person meetings on key results
    and decision points

-   Present your work at local events and conferences

-   Do some soul‑searching as to what type of career you want to pursue,
    e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused,
    non‑academic jobs like data science or science writing.

-   Assist in training and supervising undergraduate students

-   Stay up-to-date, and keep Mark up-to-date, on any deadlines that you
    need to meet to fulfil the training programme, School or Faculty
    requirements for your PhD.

MSc/undergraduate project student
---------------------------------

The primary goal of a project student is to produce a quality piece of
written work, that reflects a solid piece of research work.

-   Work on your assigned research project

-   Plan your research time according to the course's project deadlines

-   Plan your writing time too.

-   Stay up-to-date on your project deadlines, and inform Mark of them.

-   Attend lab meetings if they fit into your course schedules.

Intern
------

The purpose of an internship is to find out how a lab works, and if
their line of research is something you'd be interested in pursuing in
future. Thus the expectations for an internship are:

-   Find out what the other lab members are working on

-   Work on your assigned research project

-   Attend lab meetings

How we aspire to work: the lab principles
=========================================

Lab motto: don't be afraid to be wrong.

We are, ultimately, theorists. George Box's aphorism "All models are
wrong, some are useful" may be a cliche, but it doesn't stop it being
true.

Strong inference
----------------

We are not committed to a single "true" idea or single "true" method of
analysis. We can disprove our own ideas, and break our own methods.

As scientists, we cannot do deduction, only inference. We cannot infer
proof, only disprove. Thus, we aspire to do strong inference (Platt,
1964). For each problem, ideally we will:

1.  create alternative hypotheses;

2.  devise a crucial analysis or model that will exclude one or more
    hypotheses; and

3.  perform the analysis (or build the model) that will obtain a clean
    result

Then: (1') reiterate the procedure to refine the remaining
possibilities.\
In practice this means:

-   Write down hypotheses, before starting analysis (or model building).

-   Discuss them with others with constructive criticism (through
    informal chats, in lab meetings, or by sharing written text)

-   Define outcomes expected of analysis testing (or models)

-   Then analyse/build

Exploratory data analysis
-------------------------

What if we don't have any hypotheses yet? In the absence of specific,
disprovable hypotheses, we always have an aim to our analysis. That aim
is a testable proposition.

For example "brain area X contains two independent populations that
encode Y and Z"is a proposition. It is not yet a disprovable hypothesis,
as that depends on our definitions of "independent", "population", and
"encode". Once we have defined those, then we can frame one or more
hypotheses.

Exploratory data analysis is what we do to turn aims into hypotheses. At
root, it is about constructing a model for the data, and using that
model and its changes to generate hypotheses.

For example, we can define "independent populations" by using
unsupervised clustering of neurons into groups based on their
correlations. That idea contains two models. The first is a model of the
relationships between independent time-series as a series of pairwise
correlation measures. The second is a model of the relationships between
those relationships: the clusters based on similar correlations. We
might observe the existence of two strongly defined clusters of neurons,
and define those as the basis for testing hypotheses about encoding.
Disproving such hypotheses takes us back to Strong Inference.

Research collaboration care guide
---------------------------------

We work with a lot of data directly from experimental labs. So that
means we:

-   Take care in all communication about private data. Discretion.

-   Respect efforts of experimentalists in obtaining that data

-   Treat their data with respect, and check it carefully

-   Store their data well: multiple copies, backed-up. And we never ever
    work on the only copy of the data (see Section
    [5.1](#sec:sci_conduct){reference-type="ref"
    reference="sec:sci_conduct"}).

Open science
------------

### Open publication

We pre-print every paper on which it is our decision to make.
Neuroscience papers go to bioRxiv. Technical papers to arXiv. Our policy
is to submit pre-prints simultaneously with the initial submission to
the journal at the latest. For some projects, it can make more sense to
pre-print before initial submission. Pre-prints are then updated with
every major revision to the manuscript that comes as a result of the
reviews.

We publish open-access whenever possible, and always when essential.
Both the UK Research Evaluation Framework and UK research funders have
rules about making papers publicly available. For some journals, we do
not need to publish open-access as either (a) their policy allows
immediate posting of the post-print to a public repository (e.g.
EuropePMC) or (b) they have an open archive, which falls within the
rules. All papers have to be submitted to the University's own paper
repository, to abide by REF rules.

### Open code

A computational paper without code is just an advert. Sometimes adverts
are fine: the model is the medium for the message, and the message is
what counts. But normally a computational paper stands or falls on the
details of its computation. And those are only accessible from the code.

In practice this means:

-   Share code whenever asked

-   Always release code with publication

-   When suitable, develop in public too

### Open data

As we openly share code, so we would like to openly share the data too.
But often it is not our data. So we make it politely clear to our
collaborators that we would like to share the data to accompany the
shared code in this best of all possible worlds. And that we will do
everything in our power to help to do so, if necessary.

Who works on what
-----------------

We aspire to this division of labour:

-   Everyone in the lab will work on at least one project that belongs
    to them. This project (or projects) will be your day-to-day work.

-   Projects and their progress and especially the lack thereof due to
    problems should be discussed openly in the lab.

-   We look for collaborative projects that will involve many or all of
    the lab members (most likely the senior members, PhD and above).
    Work on such projects will likely revolve around all-day hackathons,
    each hackathon focused on tackling a specific problem by harnessing
    the different skills and expertise within the lab. Our ["spectral
    rejection" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04747) was based on
    work created during 5 hackathons spread over 6 months.

Policies
========

Scientific conduct {#sec:sci_conduct}
------------------

Thanks to the replication and reproducibility crises, and the
ever-growing awareness of the mis(use) of statistics, the scientific
conduct of researchers is more scrutinised than ever. These are our
basic policies for conducting science:

Experimental data are sacrosanct

:   We do not alter the content of experimental data. There should
    always be a complete, untouched set of any data files we obtain.
    Never load the only copy of any data set. Any changes to the
    formatting of data (e.g. changing from arrays to tables) are saved
    as copies.

Simulations should be replicable

:   Every simulation in a paper should be replicable in principle: the
    same code run again with the same parameters should produce the same
    results. Hint: always save parameters from any simulation code that
    will be used for a paper. That includes the random number generator
    seed.

Document your work

:   Use whatever works for you, but document your work. That could be a
    lab book, whether paper or tablet, with notes on each analysis or
    each simulation. Or typing notes. Or exporting key plots to
    Powerpoint, Google Docs etc. Or using a Jupyter notebook or
    RMarkdown to encapsulate what you've done, if you're comfortable
    with those things. Do something, so that you can give *accurate*
    answers to: what have you been working on? And: what have you found?

Every file is duplicated

:   Your computer will die. All working files on your computer should be
    replicated elsewhere, at all times. At minimum, use an automated
    program to back up to an external hard-drive. Better, use
    cloud-based storage - this will also let you sync work across
    machines.

A Just Culture

:   As scientists we are always learning: about new ways of analysing
    data, about our own findings, about new models, about new published
    research. And learning is inherently about making mistakes and
    errors, in order to correct our skills and knowledge. So the lab
    operates a "Just Culture", not a blame culture: mistakes and errors
    are expected; mistakes are not blamed on the individual; and
    mistakes are used as opportunities for learning by the lab: how to
    adjust our approaches to catch errors in the future.

**An example of Mark's mistakes**. Chapters 4 and 5 of my PhD thesis
contain a spiking neuron model of the feedback loop between the globus
pallidus (GP) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). As thrilling as it
sounds. This is a negative feedback loop: the GP inhibits the STN; the
STN excites the GP. However, in the midst of writing up Chapter 4, I
discovered my code had a tiny but crucial error: the STN input to the GP
had a minus sign in front of it. It was inhibiting, not exciting, GP.
Already past the end of my funding, I had to ditch all the simulations
that were to make up Chapters 4 and 5, and ran them all again from
scratch. The lesson for the future: when coding connections between
neurons, don't write the sign of the connection into the arithmetic
(Input = A - w.B); always write the sign into the weights: (e.g. Inputs
= A + w.B, and w = -1). That way, a quick glance down the parameter
values at the top of the code will show up any errors.

Authorship
----------

Until we reach that bright future where papers are no longer the de
facto currency of academia, and/or where author names are solely linked
to contributions like film credits, authorship will remain a tricky
subject. Who gets their name on the paper, and where it goes on the list
of authors, can cause problems. Our criteria are simple, and similar in
spirit to the criteria of the
[ICMJE](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html)
guidelines:

1.  Substantial intellectual contribution to the content of the paper,
    AND

2.  Contribute to the written content of the manuscript in a meaningful
    way \[by contributing text and/or substantial editing; and approving
    the final manuscript\]

The usual model is that the postdoc or PhD student leading the research
project will be first author on publications from that project; and Mark
will be listed as the senior author.

Authorship is open to discussion. Especially when we co-author with
collaborators outside the lab, there will be discussions based on the
balance of contributions, from e.g. the collection of data versus the
analysis of data.

The badge of "corresponding author" can carry weight: it is the author
taking ultimate responsibility for all the content of the paper, on
behalf of all other authors. Typically this will be Mark. But this will
be discussed if it is clear the intellectual contribution of the lead
author merits being the corresponding author.

Work/life balance
-----------------

Working hours

:   Scientific research is target-based, not hour based. If you are
    producing a constant, evident stream of work - dead-ends and all -
    then you're doing it right. Core hours for the lab are 10am - 4pm.
    All lab meetings will be within those hours.

Email policy

:   Turn it off. Keep your focus. We use Slack precisely so that you do
    not have to check email to keep intra-lab communications going.
    Check your email when you need to use it yourself; or when you have
    time to execute on whatever is there. Strongly advise that you do
    not have work email on your phone.

Slack policy

:   Set notifications to only arrive during core work hours (10am -
    4pm). Mark will occasionally send out of hours, as I sometimes have
    to shuffle email/Slack around other commitments; and when I remember
    stuff that needs sorting. There is no expectation to respond until
    the core work hours.

Holidays

:   Take some. Take a day off to recharge after intense bouts of work.
    Take a week or two off to get away from research. Mark takes a
    non-negotiable two weeks off at Christmas, and turns down all
    requests for work, reviews, grants etc to do so. It's awesome.

Behavioural conduct
-------------------

All lab members are expected to abide by the University of Nottingham's
policies for behavioural conduct. Briefly, these are:

-   [The Dignity at Nottingham
    policy](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/hr/guidesandsupport/complaintsgrievanceanddignity/dignity/dignity-at-nottingham.aspx).
    That everyone has a right to work in a positive, supportive
    environment, where harassment and bullying are unacceptable.

-   [Equality and Diversity
    policies](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/hr/guidesandsupport/equalityanddiversitypolicies/index.aspx).
    That diversity across age, gender, race, culture, physical and
    mental ability, religion are to be celebrated.

Who we work with
================

It's good to know who we know. These are the lab's collaborators across
the world. Some of these labs are where the data comes from. Some of
them we share code with. Some of them we work with informally,
exchanging ideas. Some we've been working with a long time; some we've
only just started down the road with.

Collaborations are a great example of the concept of "X-teams": a team
created to solve a problem or do a task by bringing together experts
from across different, permanent teams. With no line management or
hierarchy, such X-teams can be challenging to manage, but are great for
solving problems we can't tackle alone.

Local
-----

Tobias Bast

:   (Psychology). Tobias' lab works on the role of prefrontal cortex in
    learning and decision-making. They train rodents on tasks, and do
    pharmacological manipulations of prefrontal cortex; they also do *ex
    vivo* electrophysiology of PfC slices. Paula Moran is also onboard
    some of these projects. We work with Tobias on analysing the rats'
    behaviour.

Nottingham computational neuroscience community

:   Our immediate colleagues include Mark van Rossum (Psychology and
    Maths); Nikos Gekas (Psychology); Matias Ison (Psychology); Chris
    Madan (Psychology); Steve Coombes (Maths); Daniele Avitabile
    (Maths); and Ruediger Thul (Maths).

Nottingam's Precision Imaging Beacon

:   Nottingham has a venerable tradition in human imaging: it is both
    the birthplace of MRI, and currently home to the first wearable MEG
    system. The Beacon is the visible entity for co-ordinating that
    work, and we are a member. The Beacon has its own dedicated
    computing cluster (to which we have access), and considerable
    funding (for fellowships and pilot projects).

National
--------

NeuraxiS

:   (Nottingham and Sheffield) A joint initiative between the
    computational neuroscience communities at Nottingham and Sheffield
    Universities. Its role is to help co-ordinate the work in both
    universities. Its first major output is the joint bid to the
    Wellcome Trust DTP programme in 2019; its second will be the 2019
    national conference for computational neuroscience. Mark founded the
    initiative, and steers it alongside Hannes Saal, Robert Schmidt and
    Stuart Wilson (all Sheffield). See
    <https://sites.google.com/view/neuraxisuk> for more.

Matt Jones

:   (Bristol) Matt's lab studies prefrontal-hippocampal circuits,
    particularly at the intersection of learning and sleep (e.g.
    consolidation and replay). He is Director of Neuroscience at
    Bristol. Mark is a named collaborator on Matt's Wellcome Trust
    Senior Fellowship. We work with a substantial data-set from Matt's
    lab on rats learning rules in a double-ended T-maze (or H-maze).
    Other datasets are available to the lab.

Tom Glibertson

:   (University Hospital, Dundee) Tom is a clinical neurologist,
    specialising in dystonia. We collaborate with Tom in analysing and
    modelling behavioural data from his patient cohort.

Rasmus Petersen

:   (Manchester) Rasmus' lab studies the brain's sensory processing
    using the rodent whisker system as a model. Rasmus and Mark held
    three joint grants during their time together in Manchester; two
    with Rasmus as PI, one with Mark as PI. We work with Rasmus on the
    analysis of large-scale imaging data from mouse barrel cortex \[Data
    are from Karel Svoboda's lab at Janelia Farm; Rasmus is our main
    contact with Janelia\].

International
-------------

Bill Frost

:   (Chicago Medical School, RFUM) Bill's lab studies the motor systems
    of molluscs, particularly sea-slugs, with high-resolution
    voltage-sensitive dye imaging. We work together on understanding how
    the dynamics of neural populations controls movement.

Adrien Peyrache

:   (Monteral Neurological Institute) Adrien's lab works on the
    prefrontal-hippocampal system, currently with a particular focus on
    the head-direction system. We work together on Adrien's data on
    population activity in the prefrontal cortex of rats learning rules
    in a Y-maze.

Jakob Dreyer

:   (Lundbeck A/S, Copenhagen) Jakob is perhaps the world's leading
    modeller of dopamine release, diffusion and re-uptake. We informally
    work with Jakob on ideas about how the release of dopamine is
    related to its role in reward processing, and its effects on the
    basal ganglia

Jose Obeso

:   (HM-CINAC, Madrid) Jose is a world-leading movement disorder
    neurologist, who heads a joint clinic and experimental lab at
    HM-CINAC hospital. Jose is sympathetic to the insights available
    from computational models. We work informally with Jose on his ideas
    for why dopamine neurons are lost in Parkinson's, and consult with
    him on the clinical relevance of computational work.

Who funds us
============

Where does the money come from? To date, the bulk of our funding has
come from the Medical Research Council (MRC). But we sit at the
intersection of many fields, so have previously applied for funding to
the BBSRC, EPSRC, and the Wellcome Trust.

Major funds include, or will shortly include:

2012-2019

:   MRC Senior non-Clinical Fellowship (to Mark). \"Networks of neural
    dynamics\". Includes collaborations with Rasmus Petersen, Adrien
    Peyrache and Sid Wiener, and Constance Hammond

2017-2019

:   MRC Project Grant (NMHB). "Resolving the size and nature of
    neocortical population codes\". PI. With Rasmus Petersen (Co-I) and
    Mat Evans (named PDRA).

2019-2021

:   MRC Project Grant (NMHB). "The Neural Basis of Movement
    Transitions". Mark sole PI. Data and support from the labs of Bill
    Frost and Lee Miller (also Chicago, by coincidence).

**The UK funding landscape**. Government funding for scientific research
is overseen by UKRI (UK Research and Innovation). UKRI acts both as
direct funder of research (via fellowships at the moment), and as the
umbrella organisation which co-ordinates the seven research councils. Of
the seven, the most relevant to us are the Medical Research Council
(MRC); the Biology and Biotechnology Research Council (BBSRC); and the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). These
councils all directly fund personal awards (fellowships) and
research-led awards (project and programme grants). All applications
work much the same way: the proposal is assessed by at least 3
reviewers; the proposal, reviews and any responses allowed are
considered by the relevant grant panel (which means three of the panel
will have read in-depth and report to the panel); the panel ranks all
proposals and funds those above the cut-off.

Third sector funding plays a big role in UK research, The UK is
fortunate to be the home of the Wellcome Trust, which funds around £1
billion of research each year. The Wellcome mainly funds personal awards
and clinical trials. Other major charities of relevance to us include
The Leverhulme Trust and Parkinson's UK.

Historically, the UK has been the most successful of all EU nations at
winning funding from the EU funding bodies, both from the large projects
supported by the EU Framework funds (e.g. Horizon2020) and the personal
awards from the European Research Council. We await our fate there.
