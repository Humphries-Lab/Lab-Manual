We are a neural data lab: we analyse neuroscience data to test computational theories for how brains work.

As a purely computational lab, we are at liberty to have looser rules than our experimental colleagues.

With Rasmus Petersen (Co-I) and Mat Evans (named PDRA).</p> <p>The UK funding landscape</p> <p>Government funding for scientific research is overseen by UKRI (UK Research and Innovation). UKRI acts both as direct funder of research (via fellowships at the moment), and as the umbrella organisation which co-ordinates the seven research councils. Of the seven, the most relevant to us are the Medical Research Council (MRC); the Biology and Biotechnology Research Council (BBSRC); and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). These councils all directly fund personal awards (fellowships) and research-led awards (project and programme grants). All applications work much the same way: the proposal is assessed by at least 3 reviewers; the proposal, reviews and any responses allowed are considered by the relevant grant panel (which means three of the panel will have read in-depth and report to the panel); the panel ranks all proposals and funds those above the cut-off.</p> <p>Third sector funding plays a big role in UK research, The UK is fortunate to be the home of the Wellcome Trust, which funds around \u00a31 billion of research each year. The Wellcome mainly funds personal awards and clinical trials. Other major charities of relevance to us include The Leverhulme Trust and Parkinson\u2019s UK.</p> <p>Historically, the UK has been the most successful of all EU nations at winning funding from the EU funding bodies, both from the large projects supported by the EU Framework funds (e.g. Horizon2020) and the personal awards from the European Research Council. Current UK government policy is to underwrite any successful Horizon Europe or ERC funding bids until an agreement is reached on whether the UK can join the Horizon programme as a third-party.

And learning is inherently about making mistakes and errors, in order to correct our skills and knowledge. So the lab operates a \u201cJust Culture\u201d, not a blame culture: mistakes and errors are expected; mistakes are not blamed on the individual; and mistakes are used as opportunities for learning by the lab: how to adjust our approaches to catch errors in the future.</p> <p>An example of Mark\u2019s mistakes</p> <p>Chapters 4 and 5 of my PhD thesis contain a spiking neuron model of the feedback loop between the globus pallidus (GP) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). As thrilling as it sounds. This is a negative feedback loop: the GP inhibits the STN; the STN excites the GP. However, in the midst of writing up Chapter 4, I discovered my code had a tiny but crucial error: the STN input to the GP had a minus sign in front of it. It was inhibiting, not exciting, GP. Already past the end of my funding, I had to ditch all the simulations that were to make up Chapters 4 and 5, and run them all again from scratch. The lesson for the future: when coding connections between neurons, don\u2019t write the sign of the connection into the arithmetic (<code>Input = A - w.B</code>); always write the sign into the weights: (e.g. <code>Input = A + w.B</code>, and <code>w = -1</code>).

It pitches projects to raise funds from investors, hires people to work on projects, and produces outputs from those projects (scientific ones: papers, techniques, and code). And just like a start-up, it has to deal with all the admin of a business: HR, accounting, marketing etc. A PI does all the things that a start-up CEO does: pitches; fund-raises; interviews and hires people; leads projects; advertising and marketing; accounting; quality control of products. Also, as they are employed by a University, they teach and sit on administrative committees. This is why succeeding in academia is about more than just being good at science.</p>"},{"location":"roles/#postdoc","title":"Postdoc","text":"<p>Postdocs are research positions typically funded from research grants. As a postdoc in the lab you are expected to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Develop your own independent line of research.
