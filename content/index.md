# Introduction

Hello reader, welcome to the Humphries' lab. We are a neural data lab:
we analyse neuroscience data to test computational theories of how
brains work. To do this, we often have to create new analysis
approaches; and we build models of neurons and circuits to test the
match between theories and data. As a purely computational lab, we are
at liberty to have looser rules than our experimental colleagues. This
manual lays out how the lab works, and the expectations of everyone
within it.
