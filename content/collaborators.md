# Who we work with

It's good to know who we know. These are the lab's collaborators across
the world. Some of these labs are where the data comes from. Some of
them we share code with. Some of them we work with informally,
exchanging ideas. Some we've been working with a long time; some we've
only just started down the road with.

Collaborations are a great example of the concept of "X-teams": a team
created to solve a problem or do a task by bringing together experts
from across different, permanent teams. With no line management or
hierarchy, such X-teams can be challenging to manage, but are great for
solving problems we can't tackle alone.


## Local

**Tobias Bast** (Psychology) <br>
Tobias' lab works on the role of prefrontal cortex in
learning and decision-making. They train rodents on tasks, and do
pharmacological manipulations of prefrontal cortex; they also do *ex
vivo* electrophysiology of PfC slices. Paula Moran is also onboard
some of these projects. We work with Tobias on analysing the rats'
behaviour.

**Nottingham computational neuroscience community** <br>
Our immediate colleagues include Mark van Rossum (Psychology and
Maths); Matias Ison (Psychology); Chris
Madan (Psychology); Steve Coombes (Maths); and Ruediger Thul (Maths).

**Nottingam's Precision Imaging Beacon** <br>
Nottingham has a venerable tradition in human imaging: it is both
the birthplace of MRI, and currently home to the first wearable MEG
system. The Beacon is the visible entity for co-ordinating that
work, and we are a member. The Beacon has its own dedicated
computing cluster (to which we have access), and considerable
funding (for fellowships and pilot projects).


## National

**Matt Apps** (Birmingham) <br>
Matt's lab studies human decision-making, with a particular interest in decisions that require effort. We work together on foraging, the problem of deciding whether to stay or leave. Mark co-supervisors a PhD student with Matt, and we are joint PIs on a BBSRC grant starting in 2023.

**Matt Jones** (Bristol) <br>
Matt's lab studies prefrontal-hippocampal circuits,
particularly at the intersection of learning and sleep (e.g.
consolidation and replay). He is Director of Neuroscience at
Bristol. Mark is a named collaborator on Matt's Wellcome Trust
Senior Fellowship. We work with a substantial data-set from Matt's
lab on rats learning rules in a double-ended T-maze (or H-maze).
Other datasets are available to the lab.

**Nathan Lepora** (Bristol) <br>
Nathan's lab works on bio-inspired robotics, particularly the use of whisker-like sensors and neuro-inspired decision algorithms. Nathan's lab is part of the BBSRC grant with Matt Apps.

**Rasmus Petersen** (Manchester) <br>
Rasmus' lab studies the brain's sensory processing
using the rodent whisker system as a model. Rasmus and Mark held
three joint grants during their time together in Manchester; two
with Rasmus as PI, one with Mark as PI. We work with Rasmus on the
analysis of large-scale imaging data from mouse barrel cortex [Data
are from Karel Svoboda's lab at Janelia Farm; Rasmus is our main
contact with Janelia].

**Tom Glibertson** (University Hospital, Dundee) <br>
Tom is a clinical neurologist,
specialising in dystonia. We collaborate with Tom in analysing and
modelling behavioural data from his patient cohort.

**NeuraxiS** (Nottingham and Sheffield) <br>
COVID-19 put this initiative on hiatus. A joint initiative between the
computational neuroscience communities at Nottingham and Sheffield
Universities. Its role is to help co-ordinate the work in both
universities. Its outputs included a 2018 joint meeting of the parties, the joint bid to the
Wellcome Trust DTP programme in 2019, and the 2019 UK Neural Computation
conference. Mark founded the initiative, and steers it alongside Hannes Saal, Robert Schmidt and
Stuart Wilson (all Sheffield). See

## International

**Bill Frost** (Chicago Medical School, RFUM) <br>
Bill's lab studies the motor systems
of molluscs, particularly sea-slugs, with high-resolution
voltage-sensitive dye imaging. We work together on understanding how
the dynamics of neural populations controls movement.

**Adrien Peyrache** (Monteral Neurological Institute) <br>
Adrien's lab works on the
prefrontal-hippocampal system, currently with a particular focus on
the head-direction system. We work together on Adrien's data on
population activity in the prefrontal cortex of rats learning rules
in a Y-maze.

**Jakob Dreyer** (Lundbeck A/S, Copenhagen) <br>
Jakob is perhaps the world's leading
modeller of dopamine release, diffusion and re-uptake. We informally
work with Jakob on ideas about how the release of dopamine is
related to its role in reward processing, and its effects on the
basal ganglia

**Jose Obeso** (HM-CINAC, Madrid) <br>
Jose is a world-leading movement disorder
neurologist, who heads a joint clinic and experimental lab at
HM-CINAC hospital. Jose is sympathetic to the insights available
from computational models. We work informally with Jose on his ideas
for why dopamine neurons are lost in Parkinson's, and consult with
him on the clinical relevance of computational work.
