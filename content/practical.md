# Practical information: how the lab works day-to-day

How labs work evolves over time as they grow or shrink, as they change
direction, or move institution. This is how we currently work:

## Intra-lab communication
We use Slack for all intra-lab communication. We use Slack precisely
so that we do not have to turn on email to talk to each other. It
ensures you can contact Mark easily. Each major project has its own
channel in Slack. See below for our notifications policy.

**Action**: Install Slack on your work PC, and anything else you
want to.

## Lab scheduling
The lab has a Google Calendar to track all scheduled lab events
(meetings, visitors etc). It has two other main functions: for
everyone to enter their holidays; and for adding interesting
external events (local seminars, conferences etc).

**Action**: Ask Mark to give you access to the lab calendar.

## Lab meetings
Lab meetings are weekly*, from 12-1pm. Meeting content
alternates: week 1 is a data club; week 2 is a journal club; both
follow a rota so all members will present. Data clubs are a chance
to present your latest results, your problems you want to solve, or
plans. When in the midst of writing paper, data clubs are a chance
to talk through the paper, explaining the figures in order. A useful
guide to presenting work-in-progress papers in lab meetings is here:

\* Weekly is an aspiration. Weeks will be missed when sufficient
numbers of people are absent

## Data storage
We're still grappling with Nottingham's new systems. The aspiration
is that each major data analysis project will store its data in a
separate folder on Sharepoint.

## Code
We use Matlab by default; everyone is encouraged to use and/or learn
Python. Mark does not know Python, as he is a dinosaur. We like the
look of Julia, but have not been brave enough to dive in yet.

**Action**: Matlab should already be installed on your PC. Register
your Nottingham email address with Mathworks, and the institutional
license will let you install copies of Matlab wherever you want.

## Code sharing
We use GitHub for code sharing. Consequently, we use Git for version
control when needed. We strive to upload all our computational
models to ModelDB.

## Writing
We write all papers in LaTeX by default; for co-writing papers with
collaborators who do not know LaTeX, we will use Word with gritted
teeth. Or Google Docs like a sane person.

## Graphics
We currently prefer Inkscape for our main needs: laying out panels
into figures; editing them; and making schematics.


## University & public holidays

Some useful information on when you are and are not supposed to be
working:

**University holidays**: <https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/about/keydates/index.aspx><br>
Note in particular that UK universities close completely over   Christmas.

**UK public holidays**: <https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays><br>
p.s. the UK calls all public holidays "bank holidays".
