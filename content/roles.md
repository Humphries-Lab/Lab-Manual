# Roles and responsibilities

Who does what, and what to expect of them – and yourself.

## PI

You can expect me to do the following:

-   Have a vision of where the lab is going.
-   Be aware of where the field(s) are going.

-   Care about your happiness.

-   Create and submit funding applications to support the science in the
    lab.

-   Support you in your career development, including:
    -   helping you prepare for a successful career both in and out of
        academia
    -   writing letters of recommendation
    -   introductions to other scientists
    -   funding trips to relevant conferences
    -   funding training at advanced schools
    -   promoting your work in talks
    -   inviting you to jointly peer review papers
    -   make available to you example grant applications, both
        successful and unsuccessful. Comparing the two will show the
        fine margins involved.

-   Support you in your personal growth by giving you flexibility in
    working hours and environment, and encouraging you to do things
    other than science.

-   Be available to meet with you, to talk about your science, about
    your future plans, and any other issues you want to raise.

-   Provide feedback in a timely manner on abstracts, posters, job and
    fellowship applications

-   Work with you on your papers. Sometimes this will be comments on a
    manuscript; sometimes this will be redrafting; sometimes this will
    be working on code.

!!! note "What does a PI do?"

    For better or for worse, the best way to understand how a modern
    biomedical lab works is to picture it as a small tech start-up. It
    pitches projects to raise funds from investors, hires people to work on
    projects, and produces outputs from those projects (scientific ones:
    papers, techniques, and code). And just like a start-up, it has to deal
    with all the admin of a business: HR, accounting, marketing etc. A PI
    does all the things that a start-up CEO does: pitches; fund-raises;
    interviews and hires people; leads projects; advertising and marketing;
    accounting; quality control of products. Also, as they are employed by a
    University, they teach and sit on administrative committees. This is why
    succeeding in academia is about more than just being good at science.


## Postdoc

Postdocs are research positions typically funded from research grants.
As a postdoc in the lab you are expected to:

-   Develop your own independent line of research. If funded from a
    specific project grant, the aims and ideas of that grant are your
    starting point, not the end-goals.

-   Become the lab expert in your line of research, including reading
    the literature

-   Regularly update Mark on your progress: from short messages on what
    problem you're tackling now, to in-person meetings on key results
    and decision points

-   Challenge me (Mark) when I'm wrong or when your opinion is different

-   Help train and mentor students in the lab (whether undergraduate,
    MSc, or PhD) when they need it -- either because they ask, or
    because I ask you to

-   Present your work: at local events; at other labs; and at
    conferences

-   Plan your future, as appropriate:

    -   Apply for jobs (academic, industry or third sector) when you're
        ready, but no later than 6 months before the end of your current
        postdoc contract. There are more, and in many ways better, jobs
        outside academia, for which you are well-qualified.

    -   Apply for fellowships, well in advance of the end of your
        postdoc. For external funders (UKRI etc), the typical lag
        between submission deadlines and being able to start a
        Fellowship is a minimum of 10 months. Submission deadlines are
        at most three times a year; many schemes are once a year. Plan
        well in advance.

-   Take responsibility for your career development: produce work in a
    timely fashion necessary to support your own career; where
    practicable, take advantage of the opportunities that arise from
    working in the lab


## PhD student

-   Develop a line of research for your thesis. Developed with Mark's
    help.

-   Read the literature in your research area

-   Regularly update Mark on your progress: from short messages on what
    problem you're tackling now, to in-person meetings on key results
    and decision points

-   Present your work at local events and conferences

-   Do some soul‑searching as to what type of career you want to pursue,
    e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused,
    non‑academic jobs like data science or science writing.

-   Assist in training and supervising undergraduate students

-   Stay up-to-date, and keep Mark up-to-date, on any deadlines that you
    need to meet to fulfil the training programme, School or Faculty
    requirements for your PhD.


## MSc/undergraduate project student

The primary goal of a project student is to produce a quality piece of
written work, that reflects a solid piece of research work.

-   Work on your assigned research project

-   Plan your research time according to the course's project deadlines

-   Plan your writing time too.

-   Stay up-to-date on your project deadlines, and inform Mark of them.

-   Attend lab meetings if they fit into your course schedules.


## Intern

The purpose of an internship is to find out how a lab works, and if
their line of research is something you'd be interested in pursuing in
future. Thus the expectations for an internship are:

-   Find out what the other lab members are working on

-   Work on your assigned research project

-   Attend lab meetings
